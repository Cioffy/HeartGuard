Abstract
The research of applying machine learning to the medical field is some of the most fascinating and complicated.
Through this research it is possible, given a dataset, to apply a set of algorithms to be able to understand how accurately 
it is feasible to even estimate a chance of alerting a person with a certain probability for a heart problem.
Estimates in the medical field are very sensitive, and finding actual, even just aggregated or anonymized data of people 
is difficult for privacy and for use in the private medical field. 
In this case for research purposes, a small dataset (of about 800 samples) was selected for the purpose of targeting an approach. 
The most complicated part turned out to be understanding, although never achieved with completeness, the parameters contained within it. 
Removing or replacing, or translating a column could be more or less "dangerous" to the medical field.
The analysis went through 7 different machine learning and 1 deep learning algorithms, and for all of them, 
a little fine-tuning research to understand if the results could be improved.
The conclusion was positive in directing the problem to machine learning solutions and allowed for finding materials and surveys 
as well as theses on the topic.
